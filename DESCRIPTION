Description: Prepares data from the food frequency questionnaire implemented
    in the LIFE/SUN studies.  Functions from this package use answers from the
    FFQ to generate  estimates of daily consumed micronutrients, calories,
    macronutrients on  an individual level.
    The package also calculates food quotients and select dietary indices. 
    Foodquotient calculation is an often tedious step in the calculation of 
    total human energy expenditure (TEE) using the doubly labeled water method, 
    which is the gold standard for measuring TEE.
